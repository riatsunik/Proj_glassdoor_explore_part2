additional office in Austin TX Using machine learning and big data analytics we enable banks and other financial institutions to create deeper more profitable lending relationships with their existing underserved customers while helping millions of hardworking Americans gain access to credit at fair transparent pricing Our proprietary credit policy is in pilot with a top 10 US bank and has been reviewed by OCC OUR MISSION Our mission is to positively impact the financial wellbeing of every hardworking American by giving them access to less expensive more transparent loans and other financial products thereby positively impacting society as a whole OUR VALUES RELENTLESS pursuit of our mission We believe nothing is impossible—obstacles are meant to be overcome We encourage and reward those

many US households the ability to borrow is an essential tool Access to credit can help individuals and families weather financial shocks smooth income fluctuations build a positive credit history and facilitate wealthbuilding purchases—all of which are key to overall financial health The American middle class is suffering because they have very limited or no access to credit Credit when allocated responsibly and designed to fit the borrower’s needs is the most powerful means of improving one’s standard of living The problem is that banks cannot lend to almost 70 of their customer base because they cannot do so profitably Aliya can help banks and financial institutions overcome this significant barrier through big data analytics technology and nontraditional sources of risk capital We believe that a FICO score of 600 is not always a 600 Current credit scoring models are often outdated and inaccurate falsely boxing in customers as nonprime when they can perform as nearprimeprime We have developed a proprietary selection model and credit policy which has been proven to expand financial institutions’ lending population by 30 or more The estimated annual market opportunity is approximately 500 billion of consumer prime and nonprime unsecured loans
